<h1>Hannah's Top 3 Movies</h1>
<hr />
<h2>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h2>
<p>This Wes Anderson masterpiece is my favourite film.</p>
<p>Visuals: the set design, costumes, bakery items, and everything in between has a beautiful artistic quality. So much so, that if a film was a painting in the Louvre, it'd be this film.</p>
<p>Plot: the plot is quite entertaining as well, beautifully written & acted!!</p>
<h2>Legally Blonde</h2>
<p>The perfect 'You Go Girl' film</p>
<p>Plot: the female empowerment theme is spot on</p>
<p>Cast: Reese Witherspoon is the perfect as a determined blond ready to conquer Harvard (what, like it's hard?!)</p>
<h2>White Christmas</h2>
<p>My favorite Christmas film.</p>
<p>Feeling: a nice cozy movie to watch to get in the mood of christmas</p>
<p>Cast: fantastic cast including Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney</p>
